        npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. npm, Inc. is a subsidiary of GitHub, an American multinational corporation that provides hosting for software development and version control with the usage of Git.<br>
        It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.<br>
        It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.<br>
        The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website.<br>
        The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.<br><br>
    
        npm is included as a recommended feature in the Node.js installer. <br>
        npm consists of a command line client that interacts with a remote registry.<br>
        It allows users to consume and distribute JavaScript modules that are available in the registry.<br>
         Packages in the registry are in CommonJS format and include a metadata file in JSON format.<br>
          Over 477,000 packages are available in the main npm registry. The registry does not have any vetting process for submission, which means that packages found there can be low quality, insecure, or malicious. <br>
          Instead, npm relies on user reports to take down packages if they violate policies by being low quality, insecure, or malicious. npm exposes statistics including number of downloads and number of depending packages to assist developers in judging the quality of packages.
